IAsyncComponent
===============

.. py:class:: IAsyncComponent
   :canonical: ansys.engineeringworkflow.api.iasyncworkflow.IAsyncComponent



Bases: :py:obj:`IAsyncElement`, :py:obj:`IAsyncDatapinContainer`, :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   Provides for a black box analysis.

   A black box analysis is defined as taking a set of inputs, executing, and then returning a set
   of outputs.

   The black box may be a solver, simulation, co-simulation, calculation, or other third-party
   analysis. While state may be kept as an optimization to help performance for slow-to-start
   tools, the component definition does not require it so that the work can be parallelize onto an
   HPC cluster.

   The "black box" term is synonymous with integration and analysis. It is the preferred term used
   in the Ansys Engineering Workflow API and documentation.

Property detail
---------------
.. py:property:: pacz_url
   :canonical: ansys.engineeringworkflow.api.iasyncworkflow.IAsyncComponent.pacz_url
   :type: Optional[str]

   :abstractmethod:

   
   URL to the PACZ file or directory.

   The URL may be absolute or relative. If relative, the URL must be relative to the workflow
   definition. While all components are represented by PACZ definitions, in the short term,
   many components are not currently defined in this way. If there is not a PACZ definition of
   the component, the method returns ``None``. In such cases, you must fall back on
   engine-specific methods to determine what the component type is.
