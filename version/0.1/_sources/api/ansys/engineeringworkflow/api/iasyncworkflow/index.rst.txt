          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncWorkflowEngine`
            - Provides the interface defining the common behavior for an engineering workflow engine.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncFileBasedWorkflowEngine`
            - Extends the ``IWorkflowEngine`` module with calls.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncWorkflowInstance`
            - Represents an instantiated workflow instance.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncElement`
            - Provides a component, control statement, or datapin.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncDatapinContainer`
            - Provides an abstract base class for something that can contain datapins.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncControlStatement`
            - Provides an element in the workflow that contains children and how they are executed.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncComponent`
            - Provides for a black box analysis.


          * - :py:attr:`~IAsyncDatapin`
            - Provides a runtime placeholder for some value of a particular type.

Description
-----------

Asynchronous API definitions.

This module contains the common API for all Ansys workflow engines, written in an
asynchronous style. It has the exact same API as the ``IWorkflow`` module and any
changes to one file must be made to the other.

Generally speaking, in addition to the exceptions already noted, implementations of
this API may raise the :class:`.exceptions.EngineInternalError` class to indicate
that an internal error has been encountered and should be reported to the engine
implementation maintainer.
